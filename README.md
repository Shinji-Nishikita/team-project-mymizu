# BlasMizu in Collaboration with [MyMizu](https://www.mymizu.co/home-en)

BlasMizu is an app designed to add gamification to MyMizu's existing app, where users are able to find MyMizu partner locations to refill water bottles for free.  The BlasMizu game allows users to defeat monsters according to how often they refill their water bottles at MyMizu locations.

The general concept is as follows:

- Increasing plastic waste in the world has come to life in the form of plastic monsters, or, plasforms.
- The plasforms can be battled at MyMizu refill locations which are viewable in a map.
- Using a refillable bottle means there is less plastic waste, and the monsters get weaker.
- Successfully defeating the monsters is determined by the number of times the user refills a bottle, and the amount of water refilled.
- On level up the user gets more powerful, but the number of monsters to defeat grows as well.

## Who is the website for?

People who want to help protect the environment by reducing plastic waste and have fun while doing it.
